2.x: add-consumer / stop-consumer should take an optional count

  When adding (or removing) multiple consumers, add/stop should take an
  optional count that defaults to 1. This would allow common doseq's to be
  factored out and make configuration more convienient.

2.x: support a deserialize-fn in the consumer configuration

  wrap-body-with-msg-id does mostly the right thing - it puts on the prefix,
  but should treat the prefix entirely as a byte array (inclusive of the magic
  bits).

  The publisher configuration has a serializer-fn to help with automatic
  serialization of published message bodies. Correspondingly, the consumer should
  have a deserialize function that allows the opposite action to take place.

  At this time, split-body-and-msg-id stands in the way of that - because it
  always marshals the received message body into a string before stripping off
  the magic/msg-id/timestamp. It must do this without effecting the body's byte
  array and return the wrapped array unmodified (i.e. not transforming it to a
  string).
