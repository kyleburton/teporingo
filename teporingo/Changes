  2.1.12 bugfix: when publish failed, messages are re-wrapped with the TEP message header resulting in the duplicate header not being sripped for consumers.  This change is a hotfix for stripping mutliple headers if present, allowing consumers to recover from the issue.  A future release will address the root cause.
