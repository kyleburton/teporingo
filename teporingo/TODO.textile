Test Cases:
 * Fanout
   - publish.clj: do not perform queue-declare! if there is no queue-name
   - client.clj:  generate queue-name when none present in @conn
   - core.clj: queue-declare! should validate:
       when a queue-name is not specified,
       assert that durable is false and autodelete is true or raise
       an exception
   Create toplogy:
     one broker
     one exchange, a fanout
     one consumer config, no queue-name declared
     create 2 consumer instances, have them increment an AtomicLong
     publish 10 messages to the exchange
     after X seconds, assert that the counter is at 20
     shut down the 2 consumers
     assert that there are no queues and no bidings to
       the fanout exchange (they should have autodeleted)
