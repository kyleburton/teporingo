;; # AMQP Consumer Module
;;
;; This module provides a wrapper around the
;; [RabbitMQ](http://rabbitmq.org/ "RabbitMQ") client library's
;; Consumer class.
;;
;; ## Consumer Registry
;;
;; The module includes a registry for consumer types and controls that
;; allow you to dynamically add (start) and remove (shutdown)
;; consumers.

;; ## Consumer Management Agent Starting and restarting consumers is
;; managed by an agent.  This decouples the act of initiating the
;; restart from the consumer that was being shut down - allowing it to
;; be completely shut down.
(defonce consumer-restart-agent (agent {}))
(declare start-consumer!)

;; This is a registry of the currently active consumers, keyed by
;; `consumerTag`.
(defonce active-consumers (atom {}))

;; Create, but do not start, an AMQP consumer.
;;
;; `consumer-name` must be a registered consumer name.  See `register-consumer`.
;;
;; `conn` must be an atom containing a map to hold the connection and
;; configuration for the connection.
;;
;; `handlers` must be a dispatch map for the event handlers that
;; implement the consumer.  Valid entries are:
;;
;; * `:delivery` *required*
;;    to handle delivery of a message from the broker.
;; * `:cancel`
;; * `:recover`
;; * `:shutdown`
;;
;; Note that though a `:shutdown` handler may be specified, Teporingo
;; implements additional behavior on shutdown if the consumer is
;; configured to be restarted (via the key
;; `:restart-on-connection-closed?`): it will send a restart request
;; to the agent in the event the consumer dies.
